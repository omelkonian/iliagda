# Default logic

There's a connection between our negation-stratification and default logic's "exceptional" construction.

# Defeasible logic

There's a connection between proving decidability of our rules and defeasible logic's separation between logic and "defeasible" inference.

# Three-valued logic

Is there a connection between our "Maybe Quantity" (ambiguous roles) with 3-valued logic?
